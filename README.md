## Overview
ChemPlasKin integrates an electron Boltzmann equation solver, [CppBOLOS](https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS), with the open-source combustion library [Cantera](https://cantera.org) at the source code level.
ChemPlasKin enables the calculation of species concentration and gas temperature over time within a unified gas-plasma framework.
This approach enables accurate modeling of both chemical thermal effects and plasma-induced heating, including fast gas heating and slower vibrational-translational relaxation processes.

## Key Features
- **Unified ODE system**: neutral gas and plasma kinetics are solved together in a single ODE system
- **Versatility**: Suitable for plasma assisted combustion (PAC) and plasma assisted fuel reforming.
- **Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with Bolsig+ cross-section input format and ZDPlasKin input mechanism.
- **High Performance**: Written in pure C++, at least 3x faster than ZDPlasKin + Cantera/CHEMKIN method.
- **Heat Loss model**: Designed for nanosecond pulsed discharges in pin-pin electrode configurations.

### Code architecture
<img src="code_architecture.png" alt="Code Architecture" width="500" />

## Getting Started
This section provides details on how to modify the Cantera source code and compile it for the usage of ChemPlasKin on macOS and Linux systems.
ChemPlasKin has not been tested on Windows. 
Therefore, it is suggested to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on a Windows machine for quick start ([check note](#note-for-wsl-users)).

1. **Prepare working directories**: (eg.`~/Destop/`)
   
   ```sh
   cd ~/Desktop
   mkdir ChemPlasKinProject
   cd ChemPlasKinProject
   ```

2. **Clone the Repositories**
   
   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cantera/cantera.git
   git clone https://github.com/ShaoX96/ChemPlasKin.git
   ```
   
   Now under `ChemPlasKinProject/` you should have `cantera/` and `ChemPlasKin/`.


3. **Test [Compiling Cantera from Source](https://cantera.org/install/compiling-install.html#sec-compiling)**:  
   You should be familiar with [Compiling Cantera from Source](https://cantera.org/install/compiling-install.html#sec-compiling).
   A Conda environment is recommended for [Compilation Requirements](https://cantera.org/compiling/compilation-reqs.html#sec-conda). For self-containedness and simplicity, a conda environment `ct-CPK`
   can be created and activated by running (make sure you have installed 
   conda, test by running `conda --version`):
   ```sh 
   conda env create -f ChemPlasKin/environment.yaml
   conda activate ct-CPK
   ```
   Now you should be able to compile the original Cantera source before making any modifications to it:
   
   ```sh
   cd cantera
   git checkout 3.0
   scons build
   ```
   You will see "Compilation completed successfully" message upon successful compilation.


4. **Obtain external libraries for ChemPlasKin**:
- Create a new branch for Cantera and check (recommended)
  
  ```sh
  git checkout -b for_chemplaskin
  git branch
  ```
  
- Fetch the source code of [CppBOLOS](https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS) and [muParser](https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/) and put them under `cantera/ext/bolos/` and `cantera/ext/muparser/`, respectively.
  
  ```sh
  cd ext
  git clone https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS.git
  mv CppBOLOS bolos
  git clone https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser.git
  ```

5. **Update `ext/SConscript`**:
   Add the following lines to `cantera/ext/SConscript`:

   ```python
   env.Append(CPPPATH=['#ext/bolos/include'])
   env.Append(CPPPATH=['#ext/muparser/include'])
   ```

6. **Patch Cantera source files**:
   Apply all the patches under `ChemPlasKin/patches/` to the Cantera source:
   
   ```sh
   cd cantera
   git apply ../ChemPlasKin/patches/*.patch
   ```

   These patches will:
   - Add electron Boltzmann equation solver integration
   - Add plasma chemistry support
   - Modify the reaction rate calculation for plasma processes

7. **Configure Git** (if not done before)
   
   ```sh
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   Then commit your changes, for example: 
   
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Modify Cantera source for ChemPlasKin usage."
   ```

8. **Compile new library**
   
   ```sh
   scons build
   ```
   
   The compiled Cantera library is under `cantera/build/lib`. It is linked to ChemPlasKin through `ChemPlasKin/CMakeLists.txt`. 
   For example on macOS (no action needed):
   
   ```sh
   link_directories("../cantera/build/lib")
   target_link_libraries(ChemPlasKin PRIVATE cantera_shared ${ACCELERATE_FRAMEWORK} Threads::Threads)
   ```

9. **Build ChemPlasKin**
   
   Ensure CMake and Make are properly installed and configured on your system (by testing `cmake --version
   `, `make --version`) and compile the code:

   ```sh
   cd ../ChemPlasKin
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   It is recommended to clean the `build/` directory if there are build errors, significant changes of your project structure or CMake configuration.
   

10. **Run an example**:
    Use `-case` to specify the running case path where `controlDict` and `chemPlasProperties` files are located. Use optional `-log` flag to control log level: `NONE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`(default) , or `DEBUG`. 
    
    ```sh
    ./ChemPlasKin -case ../examples/H2O2He -log DEBUG
    ```

11. **Check results**:
    
    ```sh
    cd ../examples/H2O2He
    python plot.py
    ```
**General Note**:
If you face difficulties during the compilation process, seek assistance from ChatGPT. It's your best friend.

### Note for WSL Users
If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may need to ensure GCC and G++ are installed by checking
   ```sh
   gcc --version
   g++ --version
   ```
If they are missing, install the `build-essential` package which includes GCC, G++, and other necessary development tools:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential
   ```

## Data input
Two input data files, cross section and reaction mechanism, are needed, as specified in `chemPlasProperties`:

```sh
csDataFile       "<case>/../../data/LXCat/bolsigdb_H2O2HE.dat";
mechFile         "<case>/../../data/PAC_kinetics/ZDPlasKin_kinetics/Mao-H2O2He/H2O2HE_Mao.yaml";
```

The `data/` directory contains:

- `LXCat/`: cross section data in [LXCat](https://nl.lxcat.net/home/) format for CppBOLOS
- `PAC_kinetics/`: unified gas-plasma mechanism files in YAML format

An optional parser tool, `parsePlasKin.py`, is available to convert ZDPlasKin input mechanism files 
into the human-readable YAML format automatically.

```sh
cd ChemPlasKin/data/PAC_kinetics/ZDPlasKin_kinetics/kineticsParser
python parsePlasKin.py --input "plasmaH2O2.inp" --output "parsedPlasKin.yaml"
```
